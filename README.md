XSugar
------

[![XSugar Tests](https://github.com/papyri/xsugar/actions/workflows/xsugar-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/papyri/xsugar/actions/workflows/xsugar-tests.yml)

Requirements
------------

 * [JRuby 9.2.20.1](http://jruby.org/) - preferably managed with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
 * [Bundler](http://bundler.io) - `gem install bundler`

Usage
-----

This project contains JRuby libraries and wrappers for
[XSugar](http://www.brics.dk/xsugar/) as well as grammars for converting
between [EpiDoc XML](http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/) and Leiden+ (a 
Leiden-style plaintext markup). There is also a pure-Java standalone
XSugar transformation servlet in `src/standalone`.

To convert between the EpiDoc and Leiden+, the utility scripts
`xml2nonxml.rb` and `nonxml2xml.rb` are provided.

To use them you can simply run:

    ./bin/xml2nonxml.rb < epidoc.xml > leiden.txt
or
    ./bin/nonxml2xml.rb < leiden.txt > epidoc.xml

Testing
-------

The Ruby testing uses bundler for gem dependencies, so you should invoke rake with:
  
  bundle exec rake

Upstream
--------

The Java XSugar source is tracked in xsugar-vendor. Customizations for this
project are in xsugar-customizations, merged into master. To e.g. update
to a new upstream version of XSugar, you would unpack it to src/xsugar
on the xsugar-vendor branch and commit the changes. Then you would rebase
the changes in xsugar-customizations onto the new xsugar-vendor. Then merge
xsugar-customizations into master and rebuild lib/xsugar-all.jar (using the 
rake task java:xsugar:build) and commit. Do not make changes/customizations to
the Java XSugar source on master, make them on xsugar-customizations so that
the merge upstream/rebase/merge workflow is more straightforward.
